# MRCD

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package is for performing CD methods in the paper "Inferring causal direction between two traits in the presence of horizontal pleiotropy with GWAS summary data".

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of MRCD from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("MRCD")
```
-->

Install development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("xue-hr/MRCD")
```
## Example

We use LDL and CAD as an example.

```{r example}
library(MRCD)
## basic example code
```

Apply 3 CD methods to 22 SNPs from 12 loci:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
results = CD_3_methods(pruned)
```

Results of CD-Ratio:

```{r}
results$CD_Ratio_result
```

Results of CD-Egger:

```{r}
results$CD_Egger_result
```

Results of CD-GLS:

```{r}
results$CD_GLS_result
```

Now apply 3 CD methods to 12 indpendent SNPs, each of them from a locus:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
sig_part = pruned$sig_part[c(2,3,4,5,6,9,11,13,14,15,18,21),]
independent_results = CD_3_methods_Independent(sig_part)
```

Results of CD-Ratio:

```{r}
independent_results$CD_Ratio_result
```

Results of CD-Egger:

```{r}
independent_results$CD_Egger_result
```

Results of CD-GLS:

```{r}
independent_results$CD_GLS_result
```

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
